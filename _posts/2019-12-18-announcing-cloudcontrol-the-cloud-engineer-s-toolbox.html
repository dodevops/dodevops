title: "Announcing CloudControl - the cloud engineer's toolbox ☁️ \U0001F9F0"
---

<p>We happen to be in a multitude of different projects at the same time. Switching from project to project is sometimes hard as the tooling and the configuration changes from project to project.</p>

<p>Now in the days of cloud deployments, this can be narrowed down to just a bunch of tools like <a href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> or <a href="https://helm.sh">Helm</a>, but we still felt that some standardization would make our lives much easier.</p>

<p>That's why we made <a href="https://github.com/dodevops/cloudcontrol">CloudControl - the cloud engineer's toolbox</a> (our first repository with emojis btw!).</p>

<p>CloudControl comes (or will eventually come) in various flavours fitting the specific cloud provider you're using. We started with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure</a> as we're currently mostly using that, but are of course open for other flavours.</p>

<p>Also for each flavour, we install a variety of features to support you in your daily work. Currently we support the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>🐟 <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish Shell</a> with <a href="https://spacefish.matchai.me/">Spacefish theme</a>
</li>
<li>🚢 <a href="https://helm.sh">Helm</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dodevops/cloudcontrol/blob/master/feature/kc/kc.sh">kc Quick Kubernetes Context switch</a></li>
<li>🐳 <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">kubernetes</a>
</li>
<li>🌏 <a href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</a>
</li>
<li>🐗 <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt">Terragrunt</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To use CloudControl, you can check out our <a href="https://github.com/dodevops/cloudcontrol/tree/master/flavour/azure/sample">sample azure compose file</a> as a starting point.</p>

<p>We have build CloudControl in a modular way, allowing for extending the supported features and flavours at any time. So if you're missing something, please get in touch and/or provide a PR.</p>
